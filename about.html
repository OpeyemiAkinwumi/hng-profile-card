        <p class="about" data-testid="test-about-about">
          I’m a Frontend Engineer with 2 years of hands-on experience building
          responsive, user-focused web applications. I’m passionate about
          turning ideas into smooth, scalable digital experiences through modern
          frontend development practices.

        <h3 data-testid="test-about-goals-heading">Goals</h3>
        <p class="about" data-testid="test-about-goals">
          My goal is to ensure that I finish the course successfully, connect
          with fellow developers, and continually upskill myself to become a
          more confident and capable engineer.
        </p>

          Area of low confidence
        </h3>
        <p class="about" data-testid="test-about-confidence">
          One area I struggle with is procrastination, which sometimes leads to
          not completing tasks on time. I’m learning to manage my time better
          and stay consistent with my goals.
        </p>

        <p class="about" data-testid="test-about-future-self">
          We are getting to the top — stay focused, stay hungry, and never
          forget why you started.
        </p>

        <h3 data-testid="test-about-extra-heading">Extra thoughts</h3>
        <p class="about" data-testid="test-about-extra">
          Every challenge in this journey is an opportunity to grow. Keep
          embracing the process, stay curious, and remember that progress — no
          matter how small — is still progress.
